RUNNING sim_annealing_experiment.py:

Temp & Cooling rate simulated annealing:
Scroll down in 'sim_annealing_experiment.py'. At the bottom of the file the parameters for the experiment can be set.
Then run file through the terminal.


RUNNING experiment.py

This runs all 5 algorithms and plots them in a graph. On the x-axis the time it takes and on the y-axis the max quality score the algorithm has untill that point.
From line 15 to 21 are the parameters to run the file. Default is set for the entire Netherlands with max 20 trajectories.
Max time is the time in seconds the algorithms are allowed to run. Its either capped by the time or the amount of iterations, which is by default set to very high.
Run the file through the terminal
